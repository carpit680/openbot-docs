# Programming with MoveIt 2

MoveIt 2 provides a powerful framework to:

- Perform motion planning (reach, pick, place)
- Solve inverse kinematics problems
- Check for self-collisions or environment collisions
- Execute trajectories on real hardware
- Visualize robot state and plans in RViz

You can use Python or C++ to:

- Define custom motion goals
- React to sensor input in real-time
- Integrate with vision pipelines or learned policies
