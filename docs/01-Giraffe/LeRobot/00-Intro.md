# Welcome to LeRobot: OpenBot Giraffe

LeRobot is a modular, open-source leader-follower robot arm platform designed for learning robotics, teleoperation, imitation learning, and real-world policy training.

The **OpenBot Giraffe** kit enables precise motion control, task learning, and human-guided data collection using a real robotic setup.

## Key Features

- **Leader–Follower Architecture**: Control a physical follower arm via a mapped leader arm interface.
- **Camera Support**: Plug in webcams to capture visual observations for learning.
- **Hugging Face Integration**: Seamlessly log, visualize, and replay datasets or fine-tune policies from the Hub.
- **Low-Cost & Open-Source**: Built with affordable hardware, fully documented, and customizable.

## What's Included

- Step-by-step setup and calibration
- Data collection tools
- Visualization, replay, and evaluation utilities
- Training pipelines using ACT or similar policies
