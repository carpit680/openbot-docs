The **Giraffe v1.1 Kit** is an affordable, open-source 5-DOF robotic manipulator designed for hobbyists, educators, and researchers. Built around a lightweight, 3D-printed frame and high-torque Waveshare ST3215 servos, Giraffe offers a perfect balance of robustness, precision, and affordability. Its modular design includes:

- **Easy Assembly:** A comprehensive yet small Bill of Materials (BOM) with a detailed assembly guide. Screw driver is the only tool required.
- **LeRobot Integration:** A user-friendly, open-source imitation and reinforcement learning project from HuggingFace that allows you to teleoperate and teach Giraffe with our servo-less Leader Arm.
- **ROS2-Native Control:** Preconfigured packages for simulation, visualization, trajectory planning, and hardware bring-up.
- **Sensory Extensibility:** Optional integration with Intel RealSense off-the-shelf webcams for eye-in-hand or eye-to-hand setup configurations.
- **OpenBot SDK:** A complete software development kit that includes calibration scripts,Python API, and C++ API, Teleop-Tongs API, and a ROS2 driver for easy integration with your projects.

Whether you’re learning the fundamentals of robotic kinematics or researching at the edge of Physical AI, Giraffe v1.1 provides a turnkey platform with full source code, example scripts, and community support to accelerate your projects.
