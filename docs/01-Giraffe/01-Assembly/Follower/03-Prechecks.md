### Tools Required

- Screwdriver *(PH1 and PH2 Bits needed)*

### Printing The Parts

A variety of 3D printers can be used to print the necessary parts for the arm. Follow these steps for optimal printing results.

#### 1. Select A Printer

When choosing a printer, keep the following recommended specifications in mind. While other printers may work, these spececifications are a good starting point:

- **Layer Height:** Minimum 0.2mm
- **Material:** PLA+, ABS, PETG, or other durable plastics
- **Nozzle Diameter:** Maximum 0.4mm
- **Infill Density:** Approximately 30%
- **Suggested Printers:** Prusa Mini+, Bambu P1, Ender3, and similar models

#### 2. Prepare The Printer

- **Materials Needed:**

  - Standard Glue Stick
  - Putty Knife

- **Setup and Printing Process:**
  1. Calibrate the printer and level the print bed following your printerâ€™s specific instructions.
  2. Clean the print bed, removing any dust or grease. If you use water or other cleaning agents, ensure the bed is fully dry.
  3. Apply a thin, even layer of glue to the print area. Avoid uneven application or clumps.
  4. Load the printer filament according to the printer's guidelines.
  5. Adjust the printer settings to match the recommended specifications listed above.
  6. Verify the file format, select files from the hardware folder, and begin printing.

#### 3. Print The Parts

Print one of each part found in `/CAD/STL/common/` and `/CAD/STL/follower/`. The files are organized as follows:

### Follower Parts

- base  
- servo_driver_mount  
- shoulder_pan  
- soulder_pan_retainer  
- shoulder_pan_pin  
- shoulder_lift  
- elbow  
- wrist_1  
- follower_base_retainer_left  
- follower_base_retainer_right  
- follower_clamp_base  
- follower_wrist_2  
- follower_gripper_finger
