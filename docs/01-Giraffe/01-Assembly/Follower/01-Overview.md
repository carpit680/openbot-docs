### A. Introduction

The Giraffe Follower Arm is an affordable, open-source 5-DOF robotic manipulator designed for hobbyists, educators, and researchers. Built around a lightweight, 3D-printed frame and high-torque Waveshare ST3215 servos, Giraffe offers a perfect balance of robustness, precision, and affordability. The advantages include:

- **Easy Assembly:** A comprehensive yet small Bill of Materials (BOM) with a detailed assembly guide.
- **LeRobot Integration:** Allows you to teleoperate and teach Giraffe with our servo-less Leader Arm.
- **ROS2-Native Control:** Pre-configured packages for simulation, visualization, trajectory planning, and hardware bring-up.
- **Sensory Extensibility:** Optional integration with Intel RealSense off-the-shelf webcams for eye-in-hand or eye-to-hand setup configurations.
