# Welcome to OpenBot

OpenBot is building community projects focused on making AI robotics easy and approachable. We work on different projects that help you learn, build, and experiment with robots without breaking the bank.

Our goal is simple: to create open-source hardware and software that anyone can use. Whether you're just curious about robotics or already building your own projects, weâ€™re here to help you get started in a relaxed and friendly way.

## What We Do

- **Low-Cost Solutions:** We design projects that are affordable while still delivering reliable performance.
- **Open Source:** All our designs and code are available for you to explore, modify, and share.
- **Learn by Doing:** Our documentation and guides are made to be clear and practical, so you can follow along and build your own projects.
- **Community Focused:** OpenBot is built with input from a community that loves robotics, making sure our projects stay useful and accessible.

## Our Projects

We have several projects under the OpenBot umbrella. Here are a few:

- **Giraffe:** A low-cost robotic manipulator that uses efficient components to get the job done.
- **Servo-Less Leader:** More details coming soon.
- **Teleop Tongs:** More details coming soon.

Take your time exploring our documentation and see how each project works. We hope you enjoy learning and building with OpenBot.

Stay cool and keep experimenting!
